# Learn React by Bob Ziroll (Intro Project)

This is the intro project of the Coursera course Learn React by Bob Ziroll available there: https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-react.  
The content of the page is based on what was seen in the course, while the design of the page has been made by me.  

You can run the app by simply running `npm start`.  
The deployed version of this site is available online via this link: https://chipper-melba-f1c7c2.netlify.app/.
